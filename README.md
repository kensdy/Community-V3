### 4. Post and Comment System

The post and comment system is the backbone of the Community, providing a platform to share ideas and express opinions. Users can interact easily and intuitively, fostering dynamic discussions.

### 5. No Login Required

No login is required to interact with the Community. This approach simplifies access, enabling users to quickly join discussions without the need to create an account.

### 6. JSON File-Based Database System

The Community uses a JSON file-based storage system, specifically in the 'data.json' file, to manage both posts and comments. This choice was made for simplicity and ease of customization, eliminating the need for a more complex database.

In the `data.json` file, the post database is stored, providing essential management features for the online community. This file not only contains information about the posts but also offers additional features:

1. **Unique Identifiers:** Each post has a unique identifier (`id`), allowing for easy and unique references.

2. **Post Details:**
   - Title (`title`): The title of the post.
   - Content (`content`): The content of the post.
   - Author (`author`): The author of the post.
   - Timestamp (`timestamp`): The date and time of the post.

3. **Attached Comments:**
   - Each post can have a list of comments associated with it, providing an interactive and dynamic experience.

4. **IP Tracking:**
   - The `data.json` file also includes the IP address (`ip_address`) of the post author, providing additional information for analysis and management.

This structure in `data.json` enables effective and customized management of posts and comments, offering a solid foundation for building and maintaining a vibrant online community.

#### 1. **Deleting Posts:**
   - Through the `data.json` file, it is possible to delete posts as needed. Simply locate the corresponding entry and remove it from the file to perform the deletion.

#### 2. **Additional Information:**
   - The file also includes additional details about the posts, such as the IP of the user who created them. This provides a more comprehensive view of user activities.

   ```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Post Title",
      "content": "Post Content",
      "author": "Author Name",
      "timestamp": "Date and time",
      "comments": [
        {
          "author": "Commenter Name",
          "content": "Comment Content",
          "ip_address": "248.161.103.175"
        }
      ],
      "ip_address": "142.57.70.192"
    }
  ]
}
   ```

#### 3. **IP Tracking:**
   - The `ip_address` field in each entry allows tracking the IP of the post author, offering an additional layer of information about the origin of interactions on your site.

Utilize these features as needed to manage and analyze posts on your forum, ensuring effective control over content and providing additional insights into user activity.

### 7. Site Access Logs System

The Community features an auditing functionality through the `audit_log.txt` file. This file meticulously records all accesses to the site, including crucial information such as the user's IP address and access time. This feature provides a comprehensive view

of interactions with your site, allowing you to monitor and analyze traffic accurately.

#### How to Use

1. **File Location:**
   - Open the `audit_log.txt` file in the project directory.
     
     ![Log File](log.png)

2. **Record Content:**
   - Each line of the file represents a log entry, displaying the user's IP and access time.
     ```plaintext
     IP Access: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - [Date and Time]
     ```

3. **Access Analysis:**
   - Use this log to track access patterns, identify suspicious activities, or simply monitor the frequency of visits to your site.

### 8. IP Ban System

The Community incorporates an IP banning feature to enhance security and community management. This functionality allows blocking access from specific IPs, automatically redirecting them to a blocking page (`blocked.html`) when attempting to access the site.

To restrict access from specific IPs to the site, you can use the `blocked_ips.json` file. Follow the steps below:

1. **Locate the `blocked_ips.json` File:**
   - Open the `blocked_ips.json` file

 in the project directory.

2. **Adding Blocked IPs:**
   - Insert the IPs you want to block in JSON format. For example:
     ```json
     ["248.161.103.175", "142.57.70.192"]
     ```
     This will block access from the listed IPs.

3. **Redirect to the Blocking Page:**
   - When a user with a blocked IP attempts to access the site, they will be automatically redirected to the blocking page (`blocked.html`).
    ![Blocking Page](blocked.png)

> **Note:** Ensure to customize the `blocked.html` page as needed to provide appropriate information to blocked users.

This ensures efficient control over site access, allowing you to restrict specific IPs and offer a personalized redirection experience for those who are blocked.
